You can use the layout setting in your post/page edit section for individual posts and archive pages to make them full-width. But what if you want to make all archive pages full-width and you don't want to have to go back and edit them all one by one?

You can use this code to force full-width layout on all archive pages:

//* Force full width layout on all archive pages
add_filter( 'genesis_site_layout', 'full_width_archives' );
function full_width_archives( $opt ) {
if ( is_archive() ) {
    $opt = 'full-width-content'; 
    return $opt;
    } 
}
